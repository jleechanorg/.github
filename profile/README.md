## 🚀 Flagship Systems

### 🤖 [claude-commands](https://github.com/jleechanorg/claude-commands)
- Automation backbone that scales Anthropic's Claude Code across heterogeneous environments.
- 150+ purpose-built slash commands compose MCP tools, shell scripts, and remote workflows into repeatable playbooks.
- Pipelines include queueing, rate limiting, observability hooks, and audit-friendly transcripts for full lifecycle coverage.
- Cross-platform setup guidance ensures Linux, macOS, and WSL contributors can bootstrap consistent workspaces in minutes.

### 🧩 [codex_plus](https://github.com/jleechanorg/codex_plus)
- Extends the stock Codex CLI with a FastAPI proxy that brokers long-running automations.
- Streaming gateways (built on `curl_cffi`) let Codex orchestrate builds, evals, and infrastructure changes without blocking.
- Bundled slash commands integrate log tailing, structured prompts, and rollback-safe checkpoints for reliable execution.
- Grafana-ready telemetry, request tracing, and alerting keep teams in control while gating risky mutations behind approvals.

### 🛰️ [ralph-orchestrator](https://github.com/jleechanorg/ralph-orchestrator)
- Unifies Claude, Q Chat, and Gemini agents into a single mission-control plane for complex delivery programs.
- Evented job graph coordinates discovery, build-out, QA, and launch readiness with versioned checkpoints.
- Reliability features include sandbox isolation, circuit breakers, and human-in-the-loop sign-offs for production changes.
- Documentation covers extending the orchestrator with adapters, observability exporters, and tuned retry policies.

### 🕸️ [ai_web_crawler](https://github.com/jleechanorg/ai_web_crawler)
- Node.js FastMCP façade with Python scraping workers for reliable traversal of the public web.
- Translates natural-language crawl intents into structured jobs that return deduplicated Markdown in real time.
- Built-in sanitizers strip tracking cruft and normalize typography, yielding clean corpora for downstream models.
- Operational resilience via caching, rate limits that respect robots.txt, and resumable streams for transient failures.
